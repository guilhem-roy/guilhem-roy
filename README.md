Hi, I'm Guilhem Roy, a student with a master degree in computer security.

I like to code in multiple languages. Mostly Python and C, but I also have coded a bit in Java and Javascript. And I'm learning Rust.

I also do some security challenges or participate in CTFs from time to time. I always learn a lot doing them.
